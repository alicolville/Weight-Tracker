                                            <p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for installing Weight Tracker on your website! Weight Tracker extends your website by giving your users the ability to track their weight, measurements and other custom defined data.

                                            <p>The setup wizard should give you an overview of the plugin and how to set Weight Tracker up on your website.</p>

                                            <a href="https://weight.yeken.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="button"><i class="fa fa-link"></i> Visit Documentation Site</a>

                                        <div>
                                            <p>Out of the box, Weight Tracker does not extend the public facing side of your site with features that allow the users of your site to interact with.
                                                You need to build these by using Weight Tracker <a href="https://weight.yeken.uk/shortcodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortcodes</a> and <a href="https://weight.yeken.uk/widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widgets</a>.

                                            <h3>Shortcodes</h3>
                                            <h4>What are they?</h4>
                                            <p>Shortcodes are a feature of WordPress that allow site administrators to extend the functionality of their site
                                                by simply placing shortcodes in page and post content. When the page or post is published, the shortcode is replaced with the relevant features.
                                                For example, a standard WordPress shortcode for creating a gallery is
                                                [gallery]. If you are unsure about shortcodes and their use, you should consider reading <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress's documentation</a>.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>Weight Tracker shortcodes</h4>
                                            <p><img src="<?php echo plugins_url( 'assets/images/shortcode-example.png', __FILE__ ); ?>" style="margin-right:20px" align="left" class="setup-wizard-image"/>
                                                Weight Tracker ships with nearly 30 WordPress shortcodes. These  <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortcodes</a> render the required forms, graphs, interfaces, data, photos, etc that power Weight Tracker and the tools that will enrich your user's experience.</p>
                                            <p>It's highly recommended that you browse the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/shortcodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weight Tracker shortcode documentation</a> to get an idea of the features you can build.</p>
                                            <p><strong>A simple, one page example</strong></p>
                                            <p>A simple example is to create a page and add the [wlt] shortcode into the content. The [wlt] is the most commonly used shortcode and encompasses the majority of the front end functionality that your user may require.</p>
                                            <p><strong>A little more complex</strong></p>
                                            <p>Using the [wlt] on a single page may not be the best option for your site and you may wish to create separate pages for various parts of functionality. Another route is to create seperate pages and use different Weight Tracker shortcodes. For example:</p>

                                            <table cellspacing="5">
                                                <tr>

                                            <p>Like shortcodes, WordPress widgets allow you to drag and drop "Widgets" into sidebars. As with shortcodes, if you aren't
                                                too sure how they work in WordPress, it's worth <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/wordpress-widgets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading their documentation</a>.</p>

                                            <p>Weight Tracker has three Widgets that you can make use of, Entry Forms, Charts and Progress bars.</p>

                                            <h4>Advanced Calculations</h4>

                                            <h4>Custom Fields</h4>
                                            <p>Custom fields allow a site administrator to ask custom questions of their users when they complete a weight entry. For example, you may want to ask the user “How many cups of water have you drunk today?” or “Did you stick to your diet today?”. From the WP Dashboard, you will see a new option under “Weight Tracker” called “Custom Fields”. From here, you can see a list of all Custom Fields that have been added and have the ability to add, edit and delete them.</p>
                                            <a href="https://weight.yeken.uk/custom-fields/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="button"><i class="fa fa-link"></i> Read more</a>

                                            <p>As of version 7.0, Pro Plus sites have the ability to give users awards for reaching defined goals. Currently you can set awards for change in Weight, change in Weight %, change in BMI and a BMI being met.</p>

                                            <p>Weight Tracker, can examine Gravity Form submissions for relevant Weight and Measurement data. If valid data is found, a weight entry will automatically be created for the user currently logged in. This allows you to mix Weight Tracker fields amongst your Gravity Forms to provide a more tailored experience.</p>
