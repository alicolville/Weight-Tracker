- Chart and form Shortcodes. That allow you to display the graph and quick weight entry form by placing a shortcode on any post or page.
- Text Shortcodes. Additional shortcodes for earliest and most recent dates entered.
- Admin: View / Delete user data. Admin will be able to view and delete existing user data.
- User preferences. If enabled, the user will be able to select which unit they wish to store their weight in Metric or Imperial. They will also be able to specify date format and clear all their weight data.
- Bar Charts. Fancy something different to a line chart? The plugin will also support Bar Charts.
- Decimals. Decimals will be allowed weight in Pounds only or Kg modes.
- Delete existing entry. A logged in user will be able to delete or edit an existing weight entry.
- Better Tables.. Data tables in front end and admin will support paging and sorting.
- Admin: Extra Settings. Extra settings to customise the plugin will be added e.g. number of plot points on graph, rows per page, etc.

= 2.0 =

This is a major release of the plugin and a complete rewrite of its core. As the plugin has grown unexpectedly the code base has became unmaintainable and each upgrade was a pain in the a$$. So, this version fixes that and provides a solid base for the future Pro version. Changes in this release:

New features:

* Better out the box styling and look - looks sharper and more presentable with no need for CSS knowledge.
* Supports UK and US date formats
* jQuery UI tabs replaced with cleaner, animated and responsive tabs.
* Shortcode name added [weight-loss-tracker] (works in exactly the same way as [weightlosstracker]).
* Admin menu has been expanded (ready for Pro version).
* Improved form validation and added more visual cues to prompt the user to correct the form.

Bug fixes:

* Other shortcodes (like weightloss_weight_difference) return the weight unit but no value when not logged in. Fixed to return nothing at all.
* Tab index order fixed on forms.

Underlying changes:

* Added caching to database queries - all queries are cached for upto 15 minutes. This will reduce the number of queries against the MySQL database and reduce overall load. It is estimated that DB queries will reduce by two thirds.
* All JavaScript (e.g. Chart) has been removed from inline statements to external files.
* All JavaScript and CSS files have been minified.
* Redundant / development copies of JavaScript, PHP and CSS files have been removed. Folder structures have been simplified and tidied.
* Increased chart height. Will be configurable in future releases.
* Major refactoring of ALL code.
* Various PHP performance tweaks to increase load time (e.g. replacing all double quotes for strings and replacing with single).
* Added additional CSS class names to HTML elements allowing developers to target their CSS better.
* Support added for multiple charts to be placed (the base to build shortcodes / widgets in the Pro version).

= 1.20.1 =

BUG FIX: Previous release broke the "Delete all data" button on admin page. Fixed.

* Replaced chart.js with chartNew.js (https://github.com/FVANCOP/ChartNew.js/) to allow graph axis labels
* Axis labels added to graph
* Bug fix. Imperial measurements are now displayed on the graph in pounds (as opposed to stones / lbs) due to this bug:

	The problem is plotting imperial values on a graph. Say you have the following imperial data (stones / pounds) data:

	'15 7','15 3','15 0','14 12','14 10','14 7'

	I originally added a decimal place to stones / ozs so I can graph it:

	'15.7','15.3','15.0','14.12','14.10','14.7'

	At a glance it looks like this should work.

	However, the 14.7 is treated as 14.70 and therefore comes higher than 14.10.

  I couldn't see a quick way to correct this. So to be safe (and save me time), I've changed it to display in pounds only

= 1.4 =

	[weightloss_weight_difference] - total weight lost by the logged in member
