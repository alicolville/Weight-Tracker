## Weight Tracker Documentation

Weight Tracker is an easy to use [WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/weight-loss-tracker/) that allows registered users of your website to track their weight, measurements, photos, custom fields, etc. History can be displayed in both tables & charts. Support for BMI, BMR, Calorie Intake, Macronutrients and much more!

The plugin is available in a Free and Premium version. This documentation will help you to setup Weight Tracker to suit your business.


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alicolville/Weight-Tracker/edit/master/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
