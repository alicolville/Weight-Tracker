# Your legacy license will soon expire
  
Within the next few versions of Weight Tracker, your current legacy license will no longer be supported. Of course, **we will honour all legacy licenses** by replacing them with a newer lifetime Pro license. The main reason for doing this is to simplify the code base and not have two licensing models to support.

> As always, thank you for your support! It really is appreciated!

## Switching to an annual license
 
 There is of course no pressure to switch to an annual license and I really appreciate the folk that purchased the plugin back in the day! The benefit of switching to an annual license is to support the ongoing development of this plugin.
 
#### As a thank you if you do switch...
 
 If you do decide to switch to an annual license, please email me at [email@yeken.uk](mailto:email@yeken.uk) with your site hash and I'll happily send you a free license for this year along with a voucher code that gives you 50% off the following 2 years!
 
## Upgrade to Pro Plus
  
If you would like to make the step up to a Pro Plus license, I will happily provide you with a voucher code that gives you the first 2 years at 50% of the standard cost. Please email me at [email@yeken.uk](mailto:email@yeken.uk) and I'll reply with a voucher code.
  
## Prefer to switch to a newer Pro lifetime license?
  
If you would prefer to switch your license over to a Pro lifetime license (a like for like replacement), then please email me at [email@yeken.uk](mailto:email@yeken.uk) with your site hash and I'll send you another license that doesn't expire.
