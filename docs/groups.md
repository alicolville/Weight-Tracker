# Groups

> The following shortcode is only available in the [Premium]({{ site.baseurl }}/upgrade.html) version of the plugin.

The grouping feature allows users to be added into groups. Grouping lets weight difference be calculated at a group level and displayed on the “Manage User Data” summary page. This allows you to see collectively which groups have gained or lost the most weight.

## Enabling and managing groups

_Enabling_

Groups can be enabled via the WP Dashboard by navigating to “Weight Tracker” > “Settings” and under “Groups” set the enabled flag to “Yes”.

_Managing Groups_

Groups can be created and deleted by clicking on the “Manage Groups” button under the “Enabled” drop down. From this screen it is possible to add and delete existing groups.

Administrators can assign user's to a group by navigating to a user's record and clicking the “Group” link. This redirects the administrator to the user's preference screen where the group can be changed.

## Group statistics

Weight Difference per group can be viewed from the WP Dashboard by navigating to “Weight Tracker” > “Manage User Data”. On this page is a section called “Weight change by group” which summarises the combined weight difference for everyone in the group.

## Shortcodes

The shortcode  [[wt-group]]({{ site.baseurl }}/shortcodes/wt-group.html)  can be used to display the user's current group.
