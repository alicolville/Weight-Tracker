# Gamification

> The following feature is only available in the [Pro]({{ site.baseurl }}/upgrade.html) version of the plugin.

Weight Tracker supports the common WordPress gamification plugin [myCred](https://mycred.me/). This allows you to reward yours users for setting their target weight and adding new weight entries. 

*Please note: This guide presumes you have the relevant knowledge to setup myCred and the core principles of the plugin.*

### How to enable

First, via the WP Dashboard > Plugins, install and configure the [myCred WordPress plugin](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/mycred/).

myCred has a collection of hooks (these can be found in WP Dashboard > Points > Hooks). Each hook allows other plugins, like Weight Tracker, to specify "on this event reward the user x points". There are hooks for the Weight Tracker events "Weight Entry Added" and "Target Set". If enabled, you have the ability to specify how many points a user should be rewarded with for each event. You can also set a limit to state that the award can only be awarded **x** times with the given time period.
