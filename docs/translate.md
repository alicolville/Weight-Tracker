# Translate Weight Tracker

All YeKen plugins are fully translatable. To translate them, follow these steps:

1.  Install the YeKen plugin (e.g.  [Weight Tracker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/weight-loss-tracker/),  [Meal Tracker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meal-tracker/),  [Snippet Shortcodes](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortcode-variables/)  or  [Attendance Tracker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/covid-19-track-and-trace/))
2.  Install the additional WordPress Plugin:  [Loco Translate](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).
3.  Navigate to your WordPress admin. From the main menu select Loco Translate > Plugins.
4.  Select the relevant YeKen plugin.
5.  Under the language you wish to add translations, click Edit.
6.  You should see a long list of all the translatable pieces of text. Click on the one you wish to edit, the in the box labelled “[selected language] translation” add your translation and hit save.
7.  Once you have added all translations, feel free to click the “Download .PO” button and email me ([email@yeken.uk](mailto:email@yeken.uk)) – I can then bundle it in the main plugin file.
